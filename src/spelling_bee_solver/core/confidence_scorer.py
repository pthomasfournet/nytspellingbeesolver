Confidence Scorer - Olympic Judges System

Multi-judge confidence scoring like Olympic gymnastics - multiple independent
evaluations combined for robust scoring.

Judges:
1. Dictionary Judge: Word in high-quality dictionaries?
2. Frequency Judge: Word in common English usage?
3. Length Judge: Word length (longer = better for Spelling Bee)
4. Pattern Judge: English letter patterns and phonotactics
5. Filter Judge: Passes NYT rejection criteria?

Like Olympics: Drop highest and lowest scores, average the middle judges.
