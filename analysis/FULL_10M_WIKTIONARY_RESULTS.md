## Impact Analysis

### Before Full Database
- **Problem:** ~50% of "uncategorized" words were trash (archaic, foreign, dialectal)
- **Detection:** 467 problematic words (1.0%)
- **Uncategorized:** 45,773 (98.9%)

### After Full Database
- **Solution:** Foreign word detection added, archaic/rare coverage increased
- **Detection:** 11,851 problematic words (25.6%)
- **Uncategorized:** 34,911 (75.4%)
- **Improvement:** **25.6x more problematic words caught**

### What Changed
1. **Foreign word detection:** 9,771 words now flagged (was 0)
2. **Archaic coverage:** 3x improvement (335 → 905)
3. **Obsolete category:** NEW - 835 words detected
4. **Rare coverage:** 2.6x improvement (132 → 340)

## Remaining Issues

### Still Uncategorized: 75.4% (34,911 words)

**Composition estimates:**
- **Valid English words:** ~60-70% (legitimate vocabulary)
- **Obscure/technical:** ~15-20% (specialized terms)
- **Dialectal words:** ~5-10% (Scottish, Irish, Australian not in Wiktionary)
- **Missing foreign:** ~5% (foreign words not in Wiktionary)

**Why still high:**
1. SOWPODS is very permissive (Scrabble dictionary)
2. Wiktionary doesn't have 100% coverage of dialects
3. Some archaic/obsolete words missing from Wiktionary
4. Technical/scientific terms often uncategorized

---

## Solutions for Remaining Issues

### Option 1: Expand Manual Lists (Quick Win)
Add ~100-200 commonly seen problematic words:
- Scottish dialect (cuddin, whaup, etc.)
- Common foreign words (zufolo, cassones)
- Proper nouns (wollongong, osceola)

**Expected impact:** +1-2% additional filtering

### Option 2: NYT-Only Dictionary (Ultimate Solution)
Generate all 4.6M possible puzzles, extract vocabulary:
- Result: Perfect dictionary by definition
- Only words that can appear in valid puzzles
- Eliminates all false positives

**Expected impact:** 100% accuracy

### Option 3: Machine Learning Classification
Train classifier on NYT accepted/rejected words:
- Features: word length, letter patterns, frequency
- Would catch dialects and obscure terms

**Expected impact:** +5-10% additional filtering

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate
✅ **Full database deployed** - providing 25.6% problematic word detection

### Short Term (1-2 days)
- Add manual lists for remaining common trash words (~100-200 words)
- Expected improvement: 75.4% uncategorized → ~73% uncategorized

### Long Term (Strategic)
- Consider "Perfect Dictionary" approach (generate all puzzles)
- Would eliminate all filtering issues by definition
- Trade-off: Significant computation time vs perfect accuracy
