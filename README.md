# NYT Spelling Bee Solver

A Python-based solver for the New York Times Spelling Bee puzzle with intelligent filtering, multi-judge confidence scoring, and GPU acceleration support.

## Features

- **Unified Architecture**: Single mode that uses all solving methods automatically
- **2 High-Quality Dictionaries**: Webster's Unabridged + ASPELL American English
- **NYT Rejection Filter**: Detects proper nouns, foreign words, abbreviations, technical terms
- **Olympic Judges Scoring**: 5 independent judges (Dictionary, Frequency, Length, Pattern, Filter) with outlier removal
- **GPU Acceleration**: Optional CUDA/CuPy support with automatic CPU fallback
- **Clean Output**: Formatted results with confidence percentages and word grouping

## Quick Start

```bash
# Solve a puzzle directly
./bee N ACUOTP

# Interactive mode (prompts for letters)
./bee -i

# Show help
./bee --help
```

## Architecture

### Unified Solver Pipeline

```
Input Letters â†’ Dictionary Scan â†’ Candidate Generation
    â†“
Basic Validation (length, required letter, valid letters)
    â†“
NYT Rejection Filter (proper nouns, foreign words, etc.)
    â†“
Olympic Judges Confidence Scoring
    â†“
Sorted Results (by confidence, then length, then alphabetically)
```

### Components

1. **Dictionary Manager**: Loads Webster's + ASPELL dictionaries (2 sources)
2. **Candidate Generator**: Creates candidate words from dictionaries
3. **NYT Rejection Filter**: Filters inappropriate words
   - Proper nouns (names, places)
   - Foreign words (non-English)
   - Abbreviations (NASA, NCAA, etc.)
   - Technical/scientific terms
   - Archaic words (flagged for low confidence)

4. **Enhanced Confidence Scorer**: Olympic judges system
   - **Dictionary Judge** (80pts): Word in high-quality dictionary?
   - **Frequency Judge** (90pts): Common English word?
   - **Length Judge** (40-90pts): Optimal Spelling Bee length?
   - **Pattern Judge** (70pts): Normal English letter patterns?
   - **Filter Judge** (95pts): Passes NYT criteria?
   - **Olympic Scoring**: Drop highest/lowest, average middle 3 judges

5. **Result Formatter**: Clean console output with grouping

### Dictionary Sources

- **Webster's Unabridged Dictionary**: ~85K words (high-quality, authoritative)
- **ASPELL American English**: System dictionary (/usr/share/dict/american-english)

Dictionaries are automatically downloaded and cached on first use.

## Configuration

Edit `solver_config.json` to customize:

```json
{
  "solver": {},
  "acceleration": {
    "force_gpu_off": false,
    "enable_cuda_nltk": true,
    "gpu_batch_size": 1000
  },
  "dictionaries": {
    "download_timeout": 30,
    "cache_expiry_days": 30
  },
  "filtering": {
    "min_word_length": 4,
    "enable_nyt_rejection_filter": true,
    "confidence_threshold": 0,
    "max_results": 0
  },
  "output": {
    "show_confidence": true,
    "group_by_length": true,
    "highlight_pangrams": true
  },
  "logging": {
    "level": "WARNING"
  }
}
```

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run basic tests
./venv/bin/pytest tests/test_basic.py -v

# Run all working tests
./venv/bin/pytest tests/test_basic.py tests/test_coverage.py tests/test_comprehensive.py -v

# All tests should pass (11/11)
```

## Recent Improvements (Phases 1-7)

### Phase 1-2: Architecture Simplification
- Reduced 11 dictionaries â†’ 2 (Webster's + ASPELL)
- Eliminated 5 solver modes â†’ 1 unified mode
- Single candidate generation with automatic deduplication

### Phase 3: NYT Rejection Filter
- Proper noun detection (names, places)
- Foreign word detection (non-English)
- Archaic word flagging (low confidence, not rejected)
- Example: anna, canaan, naacp, ncaa filtered from N ACUOTP puzzle

### Phase 4: Olympic Judges Scoring
- 5 independent judges with different criteria
- Outlier removal (drop highest/lowest)
- Better discrimination between words
- Example: "account" 86.7%, "coconut" 80.0%, archaic words ~55%

### Phase 6: Cleanup
- Removed 23 temporary files (6,951 lines)
- Restored configuration
- All tests passing (11/11 in 9.78s)

## NYT Spelling Bee Rules

- Words must contain at least 4 letters
- Words must include the center (required) letter
- Letters can be used more than once
- No offensive, obscure, hyphenated, or proper nouns
- 4-letter words = 1 point
- Longer words = 1 point per letter
- Pangrams (use all 7 letters) = word length + 7 bonus points

## Confidence Scores

- **85-90%**: Very common words with good length (account, coconut)
- **75-85%**: Normal words, good patterns (contact, pontoon)
- **65-75%**: Less common but valid English words
- **55-65%**: Archaic or unusual words (may or may not be accepted)
- **Below 55%**: Unlikely to be accepted

## GPU Acceleration (Optional)

If CuPy is installed, GPU acceleration is automatically used for:
- Large dictionary scans
- Batch filtering operations
- Optional anagram generation (future)

CPU fallback is automatic if GPU is unavailable.

## Troubleshooting

### "Config file not found"
Normal on first run. Solver uses built-in defaults.

### "CUDA-NLTK dependencies not available"
Optional warning. GPU features disabled, CPU mode active.

### Tests failing
Run: `./venv/bin/pytest tests/test_basic.py -v`
Expected: 3/3 tests passing
