- **Better Accuracy**: Focuses on words actually likely to be in NYT puzzles

## NYT Spelling Bee Rules

- Words must contain at least 4 letters
- Words must include the center letter
- Letters can be used more than once
- No offensive, obscure, hyphenated, or proper nouns
- 4-letter words = 1 point
- Longer words = 1 point per letter
- Pangrams (use all 7 letters) = word length + 7 bonus points

## Confidence Scoring

The solver assigns each word a confidence score (60-100% displayed):

- **100%**: Very common words (occupant, potato, upon)
- **80-90%**: Recognizable words, common compounds (retailer, heather)
- **70%**: Less common but standard English words (coupon, theatre)
- **60-69%**: Words that might be accepted but less certain
- **<60%**: Filtered out by default (use --all to see them)

## Examples

### Tuesday September 30, 2025

- Center: **I**, Outer: **BELCOT**
- **46 words, 204 points**
- Pangram: **COLLECTIBLE**

### Monday September 29, 2025

- Top words: occupant (pangram), potato, output, coupon, upon
